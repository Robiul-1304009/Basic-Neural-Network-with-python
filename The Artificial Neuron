Artificial Neuron:

The biological neuron is simulated in an ANN by an activation function. In classification
tasks (e.g. identifying spam e-mails) this activation function must have a “switch on”
characteristic – in other words, once the input is greater than a certain value, the output
should change state i.e. from 0 to 1, from -1 to 1 or from 0 to >0. This simulates the
“turning on” of a biological neuron. A common activation function that is used is the
sigmoid function: 

f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-z))
