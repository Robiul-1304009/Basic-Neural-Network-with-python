Biological neurons are connected hierarchical networks, 
with the outputs of some neurons being the inputs to others. 
We can represent these networks as connected layers of nodes. 
Each node takes multiple weighted inputs, 
applies the activation function to the summation of these inputs,
and in doing so generates an output.
