What is Artificial Neural Network?
Answer: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are software implementations of the neuronal
structure of our brains. Artificial neural networks attempt to simplify and mimic this brain behavior. They can be
trained in a supervised or unsupervised manner. In a supervised ANN, the network is
trained by providing matched input and output data samples, with the intention of getting
the ANN to provide a desired output for a given input. An example is an e-mail spam
filter – the input training data could be the count of various words in the body of the email, and the output training data would be a classification of whether the e-mail was
truly spam or not. If many examples of e-mails are passed through the neural network
this allows the network to learn what input data makes it likely that an e-mail is spam or
not. This learning takes place be adjusting the weights of the ANN connections, but this
will be discussed further in the next section. 


What is the neural network?
Answer: The neural network in a person’s brain is a hugely
interconnected network of neurons, where the output of any given neuron may be the
input to thousands of other neurons. Learning occurs by repeatedly activating certain
neural connections over others, and this reinforces those connections. This
makes them more likely to produce a desired outcome given a specified input. This
learning involves feedback – when the desired outcome occurs, the neural connections
causing that outcome becomes strengthened.
